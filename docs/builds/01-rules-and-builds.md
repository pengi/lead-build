# Rules and Builds

Rules and builds are special value types in Lead. They are not ordinary literals; they are created using the builtin constructors `pb.rule` and `pb.build`.

## Rules

A rule specifies how to transform inputs into outputs. Create a rule with the builtin constructor `pb.rule` by providing a function that declares the variables the rule uses (for example `|{input, output, ...}|`) and returns an object describing the rule template and metadata.

Object matcher defaults (`?`) are not supported in `pb.rule` argument matchers. Keep rule arguments as direct field matches.

Common fields returned by that object:
- `command` - the command template, typically a list of command-line arguments (for example `["gcc", "-c", "-o", output, "-MMD", "-MF", "${output}.d", input]`) or a string template.
- `description` - short, human-readable text shown in build output.
- Optional fields such as `depfile`, `rspfile`, `pool`, etc., which control additional Ninja features.

The variables named in the rule function become placeholders used when emitting the Ninja rule; pb maps those placeholders to Ninja variables (e.g. `$in` / `$out`) as part of the translation. pb also generates a stable, unique rule name derived from the rule's template.

When the rule is emitted to Ninja, the Lead variables `input` and `output` are mapped to the Ninja placeholders `$in` and `$out`; this is necessary because `in` is a reserved keyword in Lead.

A simple example, which compiles a file to an object file with dependency tracking:

```
rule_compile = pb.rule |{input, output, ...}|
    {
        command = ["gcc", "-c", "-o", output, "-MMD", "-MF", "${output}.d", input];
        depfile = "${output}.d";
    };
```

will generate a rule:
```
rule gcc_c_o_MMD
  command = gcc -c -o ${out} -MMD -MF ${out}.d ${in}
  depfile = ${out}.d
```

where the name of the rule is generated from the command, and is guaranteed to be unique

## Builds

A build is an instance of a rule applied to concrete inputs and outputs. In Lead, a build is constructed with `pb.build` and references a rule plus the relevant inputs, outputs, and parameters, which will generate a `build` statement in the output `ninja.build`.

When constructing a build, set the following fields:

- `rule` - the rule object produced by `pb.rule`
- `input` - the file or files needed by the build
- `output` - the file or files produced by the build

Minimal example:

```lead
|{pb, cwd, ...}|
let
  cc_rule = pb.rule (|{input, output, ...}| {
    command = ["gcc", "-o", output, "-MMD", "-MF", "${output}.d", input];
    depfile = "${output}.d";
  });

  my_build = pb.build {
    rule = cc_rule;
    input = [cwd / "src" / "main.c"];
    output = cwd / "build" / "main.o";
  };
in
  my_build
```

Generating a `build.ninja` file as:

```ninja
rule gcc_o_MMD_MF
  command = gcc -o ${out} -MMD -MF ${out}.d ${in}
  depfile = ${out}.d

build build/main.o: gcc_o_MMD_MF src/main.c
```

## Dependency chains

The output produced by one `pb.build` can be used as the input to another `pb.build`. This creates a dependency chain, so the generated build graph ensures that the earlier build completes before the later one runs.

```lead
|{pb, cwd, ...}|
let
  cc_rule = pb.rule (|{input, output, ...}| {
      command = ["gcc", "-c", "-o", output, "-MMD", "-MF", "${output}.d", input];
      depfile = "${output}.d";
  });

  link_rule = pb.rule (|{input, output, ...}| {
      command = ["gcc", "-o", output, input];
  });

  objs = [
    (pb.build {
      rule = cc_rule;
      input = [cwd / "src" / "main.c"];
      output = cwd / "build" / "main.o";
    })
  ];

  app = pb.build {
    rule = link_rule;
    input = objs;
    output = cwd / "build" / "app";
  };
in
  app
```

generating a build.ninja file as:
```ninja
rule gcc_o
  command = gcc -o ${out} ${in}

rule gcc_c_o_MMD
  command = gcc -c -o ${out} -MMD -MF ${out}.d ${in}
  depfile = ${out}.d

build build/main.o: gcc_c_o_MMD src/main.c

build build/app: gcc_o build/main.o
```

In this pattern, the first build becomes an input to the second build, forming a simple build dependency chain.

In this chapter, we looked at the concepts behind constructing builds. In the next chapter, we will look at how to use language constructs to separate *how* to build from *what* to build.
